Technology and Security

Recently in the news I saw the huge ordeal between the government and Apple concerning the security of people and their 
beloved devices. Apple wasn’t willing to create a entry for the government to access locked data in a device owned by 
an individual. Some praised Apple for sticking to their guns while others felt they should just let ‘em on in. 

After much thought, I found my position on the topic. I feel that there should be a way to access data from an individual's 
device if there is a life or death need for the information. We are smart people so I know we can build the technology 
that meets in the middle. I know people freak out about their privacy but if you’re on the up and up, what’s the big deal? 
If you’re not on the upside of things, maybe you shouldn’t use a phone to store your data. 
Problem solved.
